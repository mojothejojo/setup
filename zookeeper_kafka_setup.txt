Setting up Kafka and Zookeeper
1. the setting up of the zookeeper can be done in the following manner:
=========================================================================
1. download the binaries from the following address:
http://mirrors.wuchna.com/apachemirror/zookeeper/zookeeper-3.4.13/

2. untar by the following command:
tar xzvf <path_to_tar_file>

3. goto the /conf directory in the extracted package and copy the "zoo_sample.cfg" to the "zoo.cfg".

4. modify the keys:

bash -c "cat > /opt/zookeeper-3.4.9/conf/zoo.cfg <<EOL
clientPort=2181 -- this needs to be different in all the files-- in our case we took this to be 2181,2182,2183
tickTime=2000
initLimit=10
dataDir=/data/zookeeper --- this has to be the location of the file zoo.cfg 
--inside the folder data will be the file myid
server.1=127.0.0.1:2222:2223
server.2=127.0.0.1:3333:3334
server.3=127.0.0.1:4444:4445
EOL"


the directory structure will look as:
<directory>/zoo.cfg
<directory>/data/myid

and in the "dataDir" we actually specify the location:
<directory>/data

and the zoo.cfg needs to be specified for the startup of the application

5.
Create the data directory and save the cfg file at that location:
and save the data directory with the file name : myid
-> the file myid will have the following text:(put any number that will be the id for the zookeeper)
eg: simply write 1/2/3.. on the top of the file 
the typical keys may be:


starting of the zookeeper can be done using the following command:
bin/zkServer.sh start-foreground <path-to-cfg-file:zoo.cfg> ie the complete path all the way upto the zoo.cfg file

eg: bin/zkServer.sh start-foreground /Users/nitish/zookeeper_data/server1/zoo.cfg

Starting up the client:
the client for the zookeeper can be started by the following:
bin/zkClient.sh -server 127.0.0.1:2181,127.0.0.1:2182,127.0.0.1:2183



-------------
then the Kafka setup can be done in the following manner:
